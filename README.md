# css-basic-tv
a basic tv with 3 squares inside and a circle made with html and css
this Tv is created by using simple css like margins, height, width, positions and background color
the html part is also pretty simple as you can see
the css is internal, not external, because when i made it i didn't know about external css:D
hope you like it as my first ever "project":D
